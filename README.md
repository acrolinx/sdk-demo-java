# Acrolinx Java SDK Demo

This is a showcase building an automated [Acrolinx](https://www.acrolinx.com/) Integration using the [Acrolinx Java SDK](https://github.com/acrolinx/sdk-java).

For integrating the Sidebar see: [Acrolinx Java Sidebar Demo](https://github.com/acrolinx/acrolinx-sidebar-demo-java).

## Prerequisites

Please contact [Acrolinx SDK support](https://github.com/acrolinx/acrolinx-coding-guidance/blob/main/topics/sdk-support.md)
for consulting and getting your integration certified.
The tests in this SDK work with a test license on an internal Acrolinx URL.
This license is only meant for demonstration and developing purposes.
Once you finished your integration, you'll have to get a license for your integration from Acrolinx.

Acrolinx offers different other SDKs, and examples for developing integrations.

Before you start developing your own integration, you might benefit from looking into:
